# TripBites Frontend

This repository contains the **frontend application** for TripBites - an AI agent that generates concise, actionable summaries by combining **live weather data**, **local news**, and **contextual risk signals**.

The frontend provides a modern, card-based interface where users can select a location, ask natural-language questions, and receive structured responses from a secured backend agent API.

---

## Overview

The application is built with **Next.js (App Router)** and **React**, styled using **Tailwind CSS** with a clean, minimal, and modern UI.  
It acts as a **thin client**: all intelligence, data fetching, and reasoning are handled by the backend.

- **Location-based querying**
  - Preset city buttons and free-text location input
